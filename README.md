# adventcalendar2020

These are my Advent of code 2020. I am no expert on Python, and welcome any suggestions to better my skills as an engineer.

Advent Day 1: Add numbers together in the list and find which ones sum to 2020, afterwards times those 2 numbers together, find the largest number
Advent Day 1pt 2: Do the same thing but with 3 numbers

Advent Day 2: Check each password to see if it contains the single character provided, also check to see if the character is found within a range provided.
Advent Day 2: Check the passwords and make sure that the character provided only appears in 1 of the spots in the range provided
